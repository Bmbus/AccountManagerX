# AccountManagerX
Simple webinterface in which you can see your accountdata!

### Intro
This project is a simple Webinterface based on ReactJS and Flask. You can add, delete und update an account. 
I created this project for learning React and get more experience with Fullstack-Webdev. Also I thought it would be nice to have all passwords into one place.

### Note:
Please use this only in your local network. This is not safe enough to deploy on a server yet!

### Installation
- install python 3.7+
- install nodejs
- install xampp (or just mysql/mariadb)
- install `create-react-app`
- install python requirements: `pip install requirements.txt`

### Run
1. start the mysql server
2. start the flask api: `python3 run.py`
3. start react app:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### How it works
If you created an account in a game (e.g), you can open the Webinterface and click `add account`. Add your data and click `ADD!` - thats all!
If you want to delete or update an account just over above the account div and click the update or delete icon!
